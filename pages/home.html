        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          I began my coding journey at the age of 14 during middle school. As
          time progresses, I continue to expand my knowledge and skills in the
          vast and ever-evolving field of computer science. <br />
          Additionally, I am an avid enthusiast of astronomy, astrophysics, and
          theoretical physics.

        <h3>My Timeline</h3>
        <i>2020-2021</i>
        <p>
          This was quite a rough introduction to professional programing, my
          parents noticed my obsession with computer so they enrolled me in a
          course at GoMyCode where i earned my 3 certificates of web development
          The first encompasses front-end technologies, including HTML, CSS,
          Bootstrap, Git, and JavaScript. The second attests to my advanced
          proficiency in React and Redux. The third certifies my expertise in
          back-end development, specifically with Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose,
          and MongoDB.
